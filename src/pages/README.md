# Views

This directory contains all pages and its sub components.
Different from the standard configuration, Nuxt does not generate routes based on this directory.
Instead all routes are defined inside `router.js` using the standard Vue Router syntax.

More information about the usage of Vue Router in [the documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/).
