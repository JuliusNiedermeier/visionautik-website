- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for the server
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Cloud hosting

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have node and git installed on your computer.
You can check if you have them installed by typing `node --version` or `git --version` in your terminal.

If you haven't alrady, you can download installers for both from these links:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing

In your terminal navigate into your project directory and clone this repository.

```
cd < your project directory >
git clone https://github.com/Visionautik-Akademie/Visionautik-de
```

The **src** folder contains the nuxt.js project that is responsible for rendering the websites frontend.
Navigate into that directory and install all node dependencies.

```
cd Visionautik-de/src
npm install
```

To start the dev server on localhost run `npm run dev`. 
The server should now serve the page on `localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

Instructions on how to deploy the app will be added in the future!
